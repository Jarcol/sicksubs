SabSub Installation
===================

The SabSub installation consists of three steps:

1. Add SabSub to the SABnzbd configuration as post-processing script
2. Add SabSub to the Sickbeard configuration as post-post-processing script
3. Add a crontab line for SabSub

Each of these steps will be described below in detail.
